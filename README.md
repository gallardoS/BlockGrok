# BlockGrok Chrome Extension

BlockGrok is a Chrome extension that automatically hides tweets mentioning `@grok` on X (formerly Twitter). It also provides a whitelist feature to exclude specific users from being affected by the filtering.

## Features
- Automatically hides tweets containing `@grok`.
- Toggle between **Muting** (hiding tweets) and **Showing** (revealing tweets).
- Displays the number of tweets currently blocked on the page.
- Whitelist feature: Add users whose tweets should not be blocked, even if they mention `@grok`.
- Persistent settings stored using `chrome.storage.local`.

## How to Use
### Muting Tweets
- Click on the extension icon to open the popup.
- The toggle switch allows you to enable or disable **Muting**.
- The extension will automatically hide tweets mentioning `@grok`.

### Managing the Whitelist
- Navigate to the **Whitelist** tab in the popup.
- Add users by entering their `@username` (if `@` is missing, it will be added automatically).
- Click **Add** or press **Enter** to whitelist a user.
- Click on a username in the list to remove them from the whitelist.

### Real-time Updates
- The extension updates in real time without requiring a page reload.
- The number of tweets blocked will update dynamically in the popup.
